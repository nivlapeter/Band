    <h1>Controversies</h1>
    <p>In 12 January 2016, Elani released a statement through their YouTube channel and their other social media
      platforms, accusing the Music Copyright Society of Kenya of corruption over music royalty disparity.Having paid
      them KES 31000 for their royalties for television and radi0, Brian, one of the band members was called by the
      society's offices and paid a compensatory KES 300K,making the motive behind the two payments questionable.MCSK
      later defended itself stating that all said by the band is not entirely true but accepted the fact that the band
      was paid peanuts but they (MCSK) later discovered a mistake on their (MCSK) part where they failed to monitor the
      bands songs for the period dated July 2013 to June 2014.</p>
